# Welcome to the MEAN MERN Boilerplate project

### _A boilerplate repository with all parts of project, following production best practices._

In this repository we will keep adding boilerplate code for a complete project which covers API, DB, Web and Mobile platform.
We should follow in both MEAN and MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, React-Native, Angular, and Node.js) in the project depending the part of project.
Different part of the project is arranged in different folders. Details of that part is available in the readme file inside that folder.<br/><br/>
